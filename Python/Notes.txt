Day 2 Notes:

- compiled language v interpreted language
Compiled language converted directly into machine code that processor can execute.
    ex. of compiled is C, C++ ends in .exe 
Interpreted Language run line by line to execute each command.
    ex. of interpreted is Python, Ruby, Java, C#
    
-- one difference between the two would be speed
