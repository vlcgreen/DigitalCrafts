Day 2 Notes:

- compiled language v interpreted language
Compiled language converted directly into machine code that processor can execute.
    ex. of compiled is C, C++ ends in .exe 
Interpreted Language run line by line to execute each command.
    ex. of interpreted is Python, Ruby, Java, C#
    
-- one difference between the two would be speed

When program executes 3 main things are needed. 
        -memory heap (where we put things in temp memory) [type of data structure]
        -execution context (reading a line, completes, and goes to next line)
        -call stack (keeping track of function calls)
    

Programming Concepts
    variables, data types, print and format strings, conditionals, loops, handling errors

Basic Data Types 
    -String
    -Integer 
    -Float 
    -Boolean
we categorize data types in order to make meaningful relationships between data.
