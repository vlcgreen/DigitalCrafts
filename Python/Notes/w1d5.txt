Functions Friday!


In Python, you create a function by:

1. Using the def keyword
2. Naming the function
3. Declaring parameters ("ingredients") *not mandatory
4. Providing the body of the function as a code block
          1      2      3
    ex.  def myFunction():
              4
            print('hello world')

Function parts: def keyword, name, parameters, body
This pattern will occur across every lang

2. make names of functions very descriptive so you don't confuse yourself later.
4. you indent for the body... when you're not ind anymore it'll be the end of code

What is the difference between loop and func?

-loop is not reusable block of code. 
-func is reusable
-loop can execute a func several times
=func can contain a loop
-func acts as a sub. 


naming convention. Camel case. second word capitalized

*Though they are technically different, programmers often use the terms "parameter" and "argument" interchangeably.
*Parameters (or the "formal parameter list") is part of a function's definition.
*Arguments are the values provided when a function is called. These are the values that are used while the function body is running.


**if you write a func and expecting val to be returned and get back NONE instead, check return statements.
